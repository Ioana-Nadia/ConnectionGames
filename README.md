# ConnectionGames
Using C++ SFML
The purpose of this project is the possibility to play three popular connection games( Havannah, Hex, and Y). 
Each of them has a characteristic shape for the game board (Havannah - Hexagon, Hex - Rhombus, Y - Triangle).
The game board is formed from little hexagons( by clicking them when is your turn, you should fight against your opponent until the game is won).
Of course, each game has its requirements, when you will accomplish one of them, you will be the winner.
